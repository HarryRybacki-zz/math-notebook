If you were to think of them as fruit, whole numbers would only be entire apples or oranges but never partially eaten ones, hence \"whole.\" More specifically, they are all of *non-negative* whole numbers. This means that they begin with zero and move \"up\" e.g.: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... to infinity. Infinity is another tricky term that we needn't worry about right now.\n",

However, 10 is not a multiple of 4 because while it also has a quotient of two i.e. 10/4 = 2 it *does not* have a remainder of 0. Going back to our fruit analogy, there is a little bit of that last apple left over.  \n",
